# 07-Side-Scroller

Let's build a 2D side-scroller! I have given you some files to start playing with, mostly a culmination of exercises and other resources we have explored throughout the semester.

The Level Class can import a (rudimentary) level file to populate the level. An example can be found in level_1.game. Feel free to alter or expand the file format.

Feel free to use any appropriately-licensed sprites, graphics, music, or sounds (or make your own). Any game should have a goal and opportunities for mastery.

There is a lot still to do, but I hope you have fun with this. Hopefully, you have developed the skills and the tools to make this an enjoyable, creative assignment.

To turn in the assignment, submit the URL to your GitHub repository.
